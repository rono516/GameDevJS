# GameDevJS
This is a simple game coded in JavaScript. A simple code <canvas id="gameCanvas" width="800" height="600"></canvas>
is chosen by it's id "gameCanvas" uding getElementById in the script tags and manipulated.
We have the window.onload setting up the main characteristics of the canvas
Then we set two players; player 1 and 2, and a ball ; including a NET drawn in the middle.
They are all drawn in function drawEverything and moved using a function moveEverything.
